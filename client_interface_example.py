target_angle = get_angle(from=MS.current_position, to=target_position)

# engineering checks ship max speed
MS.engine.max_velocity
# 150 per second
# so, with 100% power, it will take 3456/150=23.04 seconds to get there.

# pilot set target_angle
MS.control.target_angle = target_angle

# okej, jak będziemy o tym myśleć per module, to jest trochę łatwiej - ustalamy, jakie atrybut i funkcje ma każdy z modułów.
# ale jedźmy dalej, miałem tu parę sytuacji jeszcze do przetestowania
# może idźmy dalej, w końcu trzeba gdzieś wylądować:

# navigation checks distance again:
get_distance(MS.current_position, target_position)
# 17
# navigation checks course again - btw we can consider checking course by the pilot, navigation would only check coords

target_angle = get_angle(from=MS.current_position, to=target_position)
MS.control.target_angle = target_angle
p
# pilot waits for rotation # TODO: rotation seems like a great candidate for continuous operations procedure
# we still have 150 per second - and we need to travel 17 units.

# hm. This is getting complicated. I think we should add autopilot feature go_to_target(target_position) which would
# fly there and stop the engines. It would work on max 10% of engine.
# yep, it makes sense.

MS.control.go_to_target(target_position)
# control: ... autopilot set for 1235, 456. ETA: T+1 second

# control: Target destination reached. Switched to manual control.

# przy okazji, wyklarowała się nowa rzecz: w logu będziemy wyświetlać nazwę modułu, z którego log pochodzi.

# now we need to leave HyperSpace. Assuming it's a habitated space, we need to:
# ask for permission to enter normal space
# make sure we won't collide with anything. Collision check is valid for 10 seconds.

# actually, flight control can give us best place to disengage, which should be free for 30 seconds.

# hm. I think pilot should only have access to controller, not the engine or thrusters. Engineer should have access to
# engine or thruster. So modules cooperate with each other - controller sets something on the engine. Controller might work properly, but engine might not -
# engine might give wrong data.

# PILOT:
MS.control.normal_space_coords = (-98.57, 45.32)
# moving between hyperspace and normal space is risky - some modules should be turned off or they might get damaged,
# so the pilot or captain should ask to prepare for disengagement.

# e.g. Engineer may want to turn off shields or thrusters or something
MS.engine.running=False
# Engine turned OFF.
# Comms might want to turn off receiver:
MS.receiver.running = False

# modules should have attribute: Hyperspace transition safety, which shows percentage of some kind of failure if the device
# is active during hyperspace transition.
# crew can run module.condition to display a dict with all data about the module, including hyperspace_transition_safety.

# CREW: ready.
# Captain: Punch it.
